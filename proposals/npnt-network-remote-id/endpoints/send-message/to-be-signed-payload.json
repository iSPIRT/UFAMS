This can also help differentiate aircraft types without sharing operationally sensitive information like the make and model of a particular aircraft. Make and model are anticipated to become available during the Registration ID lookup process. UAS Type is also useful for correlating visual observation with data received. The types were formulated based on unique flight characteristics. The possible values are in Table 2 of ASTM Remote Id Spec"
